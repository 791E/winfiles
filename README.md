# VSparl's dotfiles

While this repository is called "dotfiles", as a Windows user my configs and settings are scattered accross my whole file system. To combat this, I have made this repository containing the necessary files and instructions to set up symlinks in such a way that all my "would-be dotfiles" are gathered in one spot.
Furthermore, this allows my configurations to stay updated and apply automatically, even if I make changes on only one device.

## Structure

This repo is broken down into directories for the different programs that store config files that I need accross multiple devices.
Each section also contains a `README.md`, outlining the usage and installation of the corresponding service.

## Tweaks.md
There is one additional file in the root directory [./tweaks.md]((`tweaks.md`)) in which I store smaller things like registry edits or scripts that I found useful but don't really have a spot in their own directory.
